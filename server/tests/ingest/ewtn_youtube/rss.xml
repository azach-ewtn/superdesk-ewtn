            <media:description>A former Finnish parliamentarian is back in court in Helsinki after a government
                prosecutor appealed her 2022 acquittal. Former Minister of the Interior, Paivi Rasanen, was originally
                prosecuted for hate speech stemming from her 2019 tweets that challenged her Church's sponsorship of the
                2019 Helsinki Pride Parade. Rasanen, a Christian, will now face an appeals court in Finland as the
                prosecutor looks to get the earlier acquittal overturned. Rasanen joins to share whether she could have
                ever imagined the worldwide attention her tweet from the Book of Romans would garner and why she thinks
                this case has sparked such attention and outrage. Rasanen gives us a brief synopsis of what is going on
                legally. She explains what Finnish law says about free speech and given how clear the law is, why she
                thinks the government continues its pursuit of a guilty verdict. Rasanen discusses whether she thinks
                the appeals court will see this case the same way as the lower court. ------------ EWTN News Nightly

            <media:description>Republican lawmakers are angry over the inclusion of abortion language in proposed
                federal workplace rules to protect pregnant workers. It threatens to derail a law that passed with
                bipartisan support and sets up a possible legal fight. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act allows
                employers to give expectant mothers extra breaks, or use a different chair, so they can keep working
                safely. But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency, recently made abortion
                eligible for workplace leave. Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the bill's chief sponsors says the EEOC is
                going rogue. Now they want to say to employers that you have to give an accommodation to a woman who
                wants to get an abortion - time off to get the abortion. During a floor debate last December, Democrat
                co-sponsor Senator Bob Casey, a Catholic, made clear that abortion accommodations were not included.
                Senator Casey said, "Under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity
                Commission (EEOC) could not issue any regulation that requires abortion leave nor does the Act permit
                the EEOC to require employers to provide abortion leave in violation of state law." However, Republican
                Senator Thom Tillis, also a Catholic, says churches and other religious institutions could be hit with
                lawsuits. Capitol Hill Correspondent, Erik Rosales reports. ------------ EWTN News Nightly provides the

            <media:description>The Holy Father urged young Russians to be "sowers of seeds of reconciliation and
                artisans of peace." On the occasion of the Russian Catholic Youth Day over the weekend, Pope Francis
                interacted remotely with about 400 boys and girls. Remembering the Lisbon World Youth Day motto, "Mary
                got up and went in haste," he invited the youth "to have the courage to replace fears with dreams."
                Organizer of the Russian Youth Day in St. Petersburg, Oksana Pimenova, joins to tell us more about what
                Pope Francis said to young people and the highlights of this meeting. Pimenova shares more about the
                event for Catholic youth in Russia, what some of the highlights were and how the Church is doing in
                Russia. She will participate in the October Synod at the Vatican. Pimenova discusses what her role will
                be and what expectations she has for this important meeting of the Universal Church. ------------ EWTN

            <media:description>A contemporary art gallery in Minnesota recently held what it described as a "demon
                summoning session." The free event was part of the Walker Art Center's Plant Teachers Day. An author
                made an exhibit on how to trap a demon. Part of it instructed people to text the word "summon" to a
                phone number, and that way parents and children could communicate with the demon. A priest with the
                Companions of the Cross and host of "The Exorcist Files" podcast, Fr. Carlos Martins, joins to share
                whether summoning a demon is ever a good idea regardless of the intent. Fr. Carlos tells us whether he
                is seeing other examples of this sort of attitude towards demons in the US these days. On another note,
                he gives us an update on his podcast. "The Exorcist Files" has a 4.8 out of 5 rating with more than
                3,400 reviews. Fr. Carlos fills us in on what comes next for the podcast and whether more episodes are
                coming. ------------ EWTN News Nightly provides the latest news and analysis from a Catholic
